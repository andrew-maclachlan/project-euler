My solutions to the Project Euler Coding Challenge

The versions of the problems I have taken from the link below.

I'm planning to complete the problems using only base Python libraries.

Update: 2022-03-21
After a long time out from this I've decided to drop my initial requirement of only using base
python code. I've been working recently on code efficiency and feel like removing the ability to use
such ubiquitous packages like NumPy and Pandas is not really helping me develop my problem solving
and coding in the way that I originally hoped.
